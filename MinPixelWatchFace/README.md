# MinPixel Watch Face

MinPixel Watch Face is a WearOS Watch Face designed with minimalism in mind while still meeting the essential needs.

### Project idea

When it comes to aesthetics, I am very picky - which extends to my phone background and laptop wallpapers.

After getting a new smart watch (Galaxy Watch 5) which uses WearOS, I just couldnt find the perfect watch face.

Thus, I created this watch face to meet exactly what I wanted a "Google Pixel like" Watch Face that is minimal while showing everything I need (via WearOS complications). 

- Google Pixel inspired minimalist design
- Support for complications
- Ideally battery efficient but needs more testing
